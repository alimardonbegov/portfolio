          company where I worked as a Senior financial auditor and become a
          developer. <br />
          <br />
          Creating and managing web or application functionality gives me
          opportunity to open up new ways for development using HTML, CSS & JS.

          developer uses in nowdays
          <br /><br />
          Being a diligent, hardworking and result oriented person, I always
          work towards achieving best result on each project.
